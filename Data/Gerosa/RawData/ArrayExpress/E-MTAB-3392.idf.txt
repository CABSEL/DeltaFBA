Comment[Submitted Name]	Gene expression for Escherichia coli BW25113 exponential growth on minimal medium with eight different carbon sources: Glucose, Galactose, Glycerol, Gluconate, Fructose, Pyruvate, Succinate, Acetate.
Experiment Description	This dataset contains the gene expression signature in triplicates of Escherichia coli BW25113  growing exponentially on eight different environments: minimal medium supplemented with 5 g/L of Glucose, Galactose, Glycerol, Gluconate, Fructose, Pyruvate, Succinate or Acetate as the sole carbon source.

Protocol Description	All experiments were performed with E. coli BW25113 wild-type. Cultivation was done in 35 ml M9 minimal medium with 5 g/L of one of the eight carbon source in 500 ml shake flasks at 37 °C, 300 rpm, and a shaking diameter of 5 cm. Frozen glycerol stocks were used to inoculate Luria-Bertani (LB) complex medium. After 6 hours of incubation at 37 ᵒC and constant shaking, LB cultures were used to inoculate M9 medium precultures with the indicated carbon sources for overnight cultivation. Final cultures were inoculated 1:100 (v/v) with the same carbon source the next day.	Aliquots of three independent cultures were harvested during exponential phase on each carbon source. RNA synthesis was blocked by adding 10% (v/v) stop solution (5% (v/v) TE-saturated-phenol in 95% ethanol) and samples were mixed and spun down for 10 min at 4ᵒC. Supernatants were decanted and cell pellets redissolved in 200 µl of TE buffer (10 mM Tris•Cl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 15 mg/ml lysozyme, vortexed for 10 s and incubated at room temperature (15–25°C) for 10 min under constant shaking. 700 µl of RLT buffer was added from the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN), samples were vortexed for 10 seconds then transferred to 2 ml Safe-Lock tubes containing acid-washed glass beads. Cells were mechanically disrupted by vortexing for 10 minutes at maximum speed. After centrifugation supernatants were transferred to a new tube and mixed with 470 µl ethanol. Total RNA was extracted from the bacterial lysates using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN), followed by removing residual genomic DNA with the Turbo DNA-free Kit (Ambion). 	Total RNA samples underwent random primed synthesis of single-stranded cDNA incorporating an amino-allyl group, which was subsequently labeled with Alexa-555.
